# HushPuppy

HushPuppy.js is a simple notification tool. Just add one js file and call puppying. 

To call a basic puppy just invoke `puppy("Message")`
Have an important message, call `puppy("Message", "warning")`
or
call `puppy.warning("Message")`

Every puppy has a life span before it disappears. Want them to leave early? Call a hushpuppy that can be closed early by your user.

To call a basic hushpuppy, invoke `hushpuppy("Message")`
